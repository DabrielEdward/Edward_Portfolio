# 🔐 Password Generator (Python)

This is a beginner-friendly Python project that generates a secure, random password based on the length the user chooses. It uses Python’s built-in `random` and `string` modules to create a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Generates a fully random password  
- Uses uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and punctuation  
- Lets the user choose the password length  
- Simple and easy to run in any terminal  

---

## 🧠 How It Works
1. The program imports the `random` and `string` modules  
2. It defines a function called `generate_password()`  
3. The user enters a number for the password length  
4. The program builds a password using random characters  
5. The final password is printed to the screen

## 📝 Example Code

```python
import random
import string

def generate_password(length):
    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation
    password = ''.join(random.choice(characters) for _ in range(length))
    print("Your generated password is:", password)

length = int(input("How long do you want your password to be? "))
generate_password(length)
