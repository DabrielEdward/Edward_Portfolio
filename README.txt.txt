 Number Guessing Game
A simple interactive Python game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number. This project was built to practice Python fundamentals such as variables, loops, conditionals, user input, and basic program structure.

 Features
Random number generation between 1 and 20

User input and interactive prompts

Feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low

A loop that continues until the correct number is guessed

A counter that tracks how many attempts the player made

Fun, personalized win message

 How It Works
The program generates a secret number.

The player enters their first guess.

A loop checks the guess and gives feedback.

The player keeps guessing until they get it right.

The game displays how many attempts it took.

Example down below:

Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!

Too low! Try again.
Guess again: 17
Too high! Try again.
Guess again: 15
Yabba Dabba Doo! You guessed the number in 3 tries!
